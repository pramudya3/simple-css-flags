# CSS Flag Learning Progress

This repository contains my practice projects for creating flags using CSS.

## What I am learning
- CSS position
- CSS layout techniques using flexbox and grid
- Drawing shapes and patterns with CSS
- Using colors, gradients, and borders to replicate flag designs
- Improving my CSS skills through hands-on exercises

## Purpose
The goal is to practice CSS design by building different national and creative flags. This helps me understand how to manipulate visuals purely with CSS and improve my frontend skills.

## Future plans
- Add more complex flags with animations
- Explore responsive design for these flags
- Share and get feedback to improve coding practices
